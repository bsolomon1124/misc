You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within directories.  NumPy, for instance, is a package containing modules for scientific computing."

    "First it is incessary to know what occurs when we use `import x` either interactively or within a script:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Import | Result |\n",
    "| :----- | :----- |\n",
    "| `import x` | imports the module `x`, and creates a reference to that module in the current namespace. |\n",

    "\n",
    "Circular imports arise because **modules are fully executed during import**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all best explained with a simplified example.  Consider a package called `circimpt` with the following structure, to begin with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "circimpt/\n",
    "|-- __init__.py\n",
    "    |-- from .mod_a import *\n",
    "    |-- from .mod_b import *\n",
    "|-- mod_a.py\n",
    "    |-- def a(x):\n",
    "            print(x)\n",
    "|-- mod_b.py\n",
    "    |-- def b(x):\n",
    "            print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no dependencies here.  The imports within `__init__.py` allow us to use `from circimpt import a` rather than `from circimp.mod_a import a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider this modified structure (**only changes noted**):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|-- mod_a.py\n",
    "    |-- from .mod_b import b\n",
    "    |-- def a(x):\n",
    "            b(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine also.  There is a one-way dependency here.  When `a` is imported, it imports `b` first with `from .mod_b import b`.  Recall that this **imports the module `mod_b`, and creates references in the current namespace to `b`**.  All of that is fine, in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, now for another modification--this time, one that will give us an issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|-- mod_a.py\n",
    "    |-- from .mod_b import b\n",
    "    |-- def a(x):\n",
    "            b(x)\n",
    "|-- mod_b.py\n",

    "    |-- def b(x):\n",
    "            a(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- Importing the package name jumps to the `__init__.py` file, where we have our wildcard syntax.\n",
    "- Everything from `mod_a` is imported, which includes the `from mod_b` statement.\n",
    "- That jumps us to `mod_b`, which has a `from mod_a import a` statement.\n",
    "- However, `a` is not defined because we already \"jumped out of\" `mod_a`.  `mod_a` itself is technically defined, just as an empty module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we got rid of the `from module import *` statements in `__init__`, this would only *partially* solve the problem.  We'd no longer have an issue on `import circimpt`, but `from circimpt.mod_a import a` would cause an `RecursionError`, as would `from circimpt import mod_a`.  What is required in this case, when two functions reference each other, is a fundamental refactoring of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, on the other hand, would be fine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "circimpt/\n",
    "|-- __init__.py  # Blank\n",
    "|-- mod_a.py\n",
    "    |-- from circimpt import mod_b\n",
    "    |-- def a(x):\n",
    "            mod_b.b(x)\n",
    "|-- mod_b.py\n",

    "            print(x)\n",
    "    |-- def c(x):\n",
    "    |--     mod_a.a(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "- If we were to `import a`, this first runs the `from circimpt import mod_b` in `mod_a`.\n",
    "- This evaluates the `from circimpt import mod_a`.  `mod_a` is just an \"empty module\" but **that is okay because we're not importing `a` directly.**"
