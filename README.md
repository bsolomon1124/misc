Self-teaching: collected notes, excerpts, & references.

**Please Note**:

- No guarantee is made as to the accuracy of these notes.  Many were made as I was just starting out in the world of code and could use updating.  Please don't use them as an authoritative reference.
- These docs may contain direct excerpts from third-party sources.  I do not claim this material as my own but rather as an amalgamation of helpful resources.
